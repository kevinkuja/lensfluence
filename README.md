# Day One Smart Contracts

---

## 🚀 Overview

Day One allows artists to tokenize their growth metrics as ERC-20 tokens, and fans to buy, sell and follow based on those tokens. This frontend provides:

- Full integration with Lens Protocol primitives: accounts, follows, token‐gated follow rules, and metadata.
- A simple marketplace: mint and burn ArtistTokens by sending GHO to the artist's Lens Account.

## 🔧 Key Primitives

1. **Lens Accounts**

   - Every user and artist has a Lens Account.
   - Buying/selling tokens happens _from_ and _to_ these Accounts.
   - Artist profiles (avatar, username, bio, etc.) live in the Account metadata, along with a `token` attribute pointing to their ERC-20 address.

2. **Follow & Token-Gated Follow Rule**

   - We wire up Lens' **TokenGatedGraphRule** so that **only holders** of ≥ 1 ArtistToken can follow that artist's profile.
   - Follows are executed _on your custom Graph_ using the Lens SDK.

3. **ArtistToken in Metadata**
   - Each artist's Lens Account metadata includes a `token` attribute (the ERC-20 address).
   - Frontend reads this to drive buy/sell and follow gating.

## 💡 Feedback & Improvements

During development we explored Lens' **Custom Account Actions** for Buy & Sell flows:

- **Action approach**: Deploy `BuyArtistTokenAction` & `SellArtistTokenAction`, add them as managers on artist Accounts, and have each user execute them.
- **Blocker 1**: The Lens SDK currently does **not** support sending a custom `value` (GHO) in Account Actions the same way as native ETH in other EVMs.
  _Discussed on Discord:_

- **Blocker 2**: Adding a custom action caused Lens' GraphQL API to return **502 errors**, making that Account unusable.
  _Bug report & follow-up:_
  [https://discord.com/channels/918178320682733648/1373051686427557978](https://discord.com/channels/918178320682733648/1373051686427557978)

**Workaround**: We fell back to a hybrid model:

- Use Lens SDK for account creation, authentication, follows & graph operations (works flawlessly).
- For mint/burn of ArtistTokens, we build raw transactions from our EOA to the user's smart account, that points to the ERC-20 ArtistToken.

⚙️ **Next steps**:

- Migrate back to a pure Account Actions approach once:

  1. Lens SDK supports custom `value` in Account Actions.
  2. The GraphQL 502 bug is resolved (Done).

We love Lens' extensibility—these improvements would unlock a truly seamless, signless UX for Day One's token marketplace!
